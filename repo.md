This repo has the following r script: *"run_analysis.r"*. This file has only one function *"run_analysis()"* which does not take any arguments.

This function needs the files in the "UCI HAR Dataset". The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder with all files and sub-folders should be in the current working directory at the time of running the "run_analysis()" function.

On execution, the function shall process the raw data from the dataset and generate the following 2 output files in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder:
##### 1. UCI_HAR_mean_and_std_measurements.csv
##### 2. UCI_HAR_average_factor_values.csv
